# Markdown Paged Media

This is a vscode extension for writing printing books using markdown and css paged media.

Goal of this project is:

-	provide a familiar environment for writing technical books in a **modern** way

This is done by 2 lovely great projects:

-	[markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)
	-	this is a default markdown engine in vscode which renders md file to html.
-	[Paged.js](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/pagedjs/pagedjs)
	-	this is a css-based paged-media engine proposed by W3C which renders chunked html pages from one big continuous html.

## Usage / Syntax

As first, vscode supports markdown spec named [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/).

As second, paged.js supports @page rule named [CSS Paged Media Module Level 3](https://pagedjs.org/documentation/cheatsheet/).

And then, this extension extends some useful syntax and features which focus on writing technical books.
You can read full specs [here](https://github.com/abechanta/vscode-ext-paged-media/wiki/Syntax_ja).

### First Time You Preview...

When you open markdown previewer at first time, you'll encount a warning button at the top-right corner.

![](media/csp-warning1.png)

This is caused by Content Security Policy (CSP) mismatch between vscode's markdown previewer and this extension.
To resolve, you have to click it and change security settings of markdown previewer from "Allow insecure content" to "Disable" so that this extension works perfect.

This is by design (for now).
This extension works completely offline and won't connect any servers via http/https.

## Dependency

This extension is made from lots of graceful extensions below:

-	markdown-it-anchor
-	markdown-it-attrs
-	markdown-it-div
